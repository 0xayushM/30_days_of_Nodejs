## Problem 9

Which of the following are examples of node modules?

a. Express <br>
b. Body-parser <br>
c. Socket.io <br>
d. All of the above

## Solution

d. All of the above

***Explanation:***

- **Express:** Express is a web application framework for Node.js. It provides a set of features for building web and mobile applications, making it one of the most popular and widely used Node.js modules for handling HTTP requests, routing, and more.

- **Body-parser:** Body-parser is a middleware module for Express that parses incoming request bodies. It is commonly used to extract form data or JSON payloads from HTTP requests and make them accessible in the req.body object.

- **Socket.io:** Socket.io is a library that enables real-time, bidirectional and event-based communication between web clients and servers. It is often used for building applications with real-time features such as chat applications, online gaming, and collaborative tools.

So, all of these modules play essential roles in developing web applications with Node.js.
